# calcMSE.R

This is a function to calculate the MSE from within animal regressions of 
a y variable (such as Feed Intake) on an x variable (such as Age). 

This trait is supposed to quantify how resilient an animal was to disease. 
The higher averaged squared error (MSE) the less resilient the animal was
during the finishing period. 

The following screenshot is from one of my analyses.
